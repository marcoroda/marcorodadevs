# /brief
This page resumes the procedure I went through to setup a Debian Linux distribution on my BeagleBone.

<!-- # Motivation
* Have a static website to post whatever I am working or worked on;
* To host documentation and to share with the hackers out there;

# Jekyll
The first step is to create a static website from scratch (not really from scratch). To do that we will use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is a static site generator, much like [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it uses layouts (default or custom) to create a static website. It is Github pages compatible, making it a perfect candidate to start with.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
To start, you will have to install on your machine the full [Ruby](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) development environment (Jekyll is written in Rub -> Ruby Gem). Having done that, create a template jekyll site with the following instructions.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

```shell
# Install Jekyll and bundler gems
$ gem install jekyll bundler
# Create a new Jekyll site at ./myblog
$ jekyll new myWebsite
# Change into your new directory.
$ cd myWebsite
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>
