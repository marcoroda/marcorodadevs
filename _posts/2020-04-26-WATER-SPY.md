# /brief
Last month I got a big surprise on my water bill, 400 EUR worth of water to pay. Turns out there was a leak somewhere by the garden and no sign of water whatsoever so I had no way of noticing it before receiving the bill. Eventually I found the leak and fixed. I have then decided to monitor the water consumption of the house and have it logged to a database where I could compare it with the pervious months and control the consumption in time.
