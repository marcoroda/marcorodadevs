# /brief
Last month my father in law got a big surprise on his water bill, 1000 EUR worth of water to pay. Turns out there was a leak somewhere by the garden but there was no sign of water whatsoever. After some digging he eventually found out where the leak was and managed to fix it. I have then decided to help him and monitor the water consumption of the house and have it logged to a nodeRed Front-End application where I could do some statistics and warn him should it happen again.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Tech Stack:</strong> ESP8266 WiFi, LoRa, Hall-Efect Sensor Acquisition, C/C++, Node-Red and Linux.

# Objectives
* Installation of a Hall-Efect water sensor; 
* Monitor the water consumption of a House;
* Display data on Node-RED Front-End dashboard application;

# General Architecture
The drawing bellow shows the system level a architecture. The bottom part shows where the Hall-Effect sensor is going to be installed. A uController ESP8266 is then used to process the output of the sensor and publish the data through a HTTP POST into a Node-RED server application running under a BeagleBone Black board. A Node-RED dashboard will then show the water consumption on a time based Graph.

# Hall-Effect Water Sensor
To measure the amount of consumed water I will be using a [Hall-Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor) sensor. The one I am using I bought it in [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000125812845.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.7fd44c4dnyLl7u) for ~13 CHF. This sensor requires 5V DC as power and it produces on the yellow line a stream of pulses where its frequency is proportional to the amount of water that is passing through the pipe. A calibration procedure will be needed to get a representative water consumption out of it.

# Veroboard making

# Sensor Output Calibration
To calibrate the sensor output, all that's to be done is to count the amount of pulses the sensor produces for a given amount of water that we feed into it. The bellow water test circuit is used for the calibration procedure:

# ESP uC Code
The uController will be responsible for two main tasks:
1. Count the amount of pulses the sensor generates;
2. HTTP POST the sensor data into Node-RED application;
