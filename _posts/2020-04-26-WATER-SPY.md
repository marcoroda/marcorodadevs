# /brief
Last month my father in law got a big surprise on his water bill, 1000 EUR worth of water to pay. Turns out there was a leak somewhere by the garden but there was no sign of water whatsoever. After some digging he eventually found out where the leak was and managed to fix it. I have then decided to help him and monitor the water consumption of the house and have it logged to a Node-Red Front-End application where I could do some statistics and warn him should it happen again.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Tech Stack:</strong> ESP8266 NodeMCU WiFi, LoRa, Hall-Effect Sensor Acquisition, BME280, C/C++, Node-Red and Raspberry Pi (Linux).

# Objectives
* Installation of a Hall-Effect water sensor; 
* Monitor monthly water consumption of a House;
* Monitor temperature, humidity and pressure;
* Display data on Node-RED Front-End dashboard application.

# General Architecture
The block diagram bellow shows the system level architecture. The bottom part, which is to be deployed next to the water source pipes, shows where the Hall-Effect sensor is going to be connected. A uController ESP8266 is used to process the output (yellow line) of the sensor, detecting each pulse through an interrupt and counting them. A calibration needs to be performed so we know how many pulses are generated by the water sensor for 1 liter of water. The sensor data is then sent over the air using the LoRa protocol. 

Inside the house there will be a LoRa RX module, together with an ESP8266 that will capture the RF signal, extract the sensor data and publish it to a MQTT broker running under a Raspberry Pi Zero. Also, to measure the ambient temperature, the humidity and atmospheric pressure a BME280 is used. To show the data to the user, a Node-Red Front-End dashboard application is deployed under the Raspberry Pi.

# Hall-Effect Water Sensor
To measure the amount of water that is consumed a [Hall-Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor) sensor is going to be used. They are worth ~13 CHF in [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000125812845.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.7fd44c4dnyLl7u). This sensor requires 5V DC as power supply and it produces on the yellow line a stream of pulses where its frequency is proportional to the amount of water that is passing through it. A calibration procedure will be needed to get a representative water consumption out of it.

# Prototyping
To validate the desired behaviour, I have started by wiring the modules in a prototype board. 2x Sets were produced, 1 to serve as TX and the other as RX. The wiring diagram is shown is Figure 3a (TX) and Figure 3b (RX).

## > LoRa TX - RX
Before plugging the water sensor, I made sure that the LoRa modules were working fine. The TX LoRa module was placed in its future location (next to the water source pipes) and I made it broadcast a counter value. The RX LoRa module placed inside the house, would then try to receive the LoRa signal and show the LoRa payload in the serial terminal. Once verified the correct reception, went on on calibrating the water sensor.

## > Water Sensor Calibration
To calibrate the sensor output, all that is to be done is to count the amount of pulses the sensor produces for a given amount of water that we feed into it. Of course this will give us an approximate number of pulses per liter as the water sensor is not connected into the real water pipe and therefore it is not under water pressure.
The bellow test circuit is used for the calibration procedure.

</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The calibration procedure was not real executed as depicted in Figure 6 but the principle is the same. I had lying around a 20 liter bottle and filled it up with water within the sensor placed in series. Th water sensor output (yellow wire) was connected to an interrupt pin of the NodeMCU making a counter increment should a rising edge occur. For 20 liters of water the amount of pulses produced were 6385, making ~319 pulses per lire.

# Veroboard PCB Making
Having verified the expected behavior of the prototype board, I proceeded on producing a veroboard like PCB for the whole circuit. I have started by making a socket PCB for the LoRa Ra-01 module (Figure 8). Then, using 2.54 mm female header I produced the main PCB that would host the LoRa TX module + the NodeMCU module for the TX PCB and the LoRa RX module + the NodeMCU module + the BME280 breakout board for the RX PCB (Figure 9).

# Water Sensor Installation
The next step would be to have real water sensor data coming in into the TX module, so we proceeded to install the water sensor in series with the water source pipe. For that, as the TX module is to be installed inside the garage, a cable was passed into the water meter enclosure (Figure 10). With all the wiring done and the water sensor installed, a simple Node-Red dashboard application was then deployed under a Raspberry Pi Zero W.

# Node-Red Front-End Dashboard Application
The Node-Red application is a simple dashboard with widgets and graphs. The data is coming in through the MQTT in nodes and later displayed in the dashboard. The code is available in my GitHub project page. Figure 11 shows the final dashboard application.
